# SMART DICTIONARY
 
![basic layout](image1.jpg) 

This project is about a Graphical User Interface I built for an interactive dictionary using Python's Tkinter. The dictionary is relatively 
interactive as in if you misspell a word, the program suggests the closest correct word to the misspelled one. For example, if you typed in 
"comduter", the program would ask if your word is "computer".

## Getting Started

If you have Python 3 in your machine, then you're good to go. Just download the json.data and front end.py and run the script. Note that "tkinter" is
a pre-installed module in Python.
